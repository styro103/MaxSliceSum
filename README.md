MaxSliceSum
===========

A non-empty zero-indexed array A consisting of N integers is given. A pair of integers (P, Q), such that 0 ≤ P ≤ Q < N, is called a slice of array A. The sum of a slice (P, Q) is the total of A[P] + A[P+1] + ... + A[Q].

Write a function that, given an array A consisting of N integers, returns the maximum sum of any slice of A.

For example, given array A such that:
A[0] = 3  
A[1] = 2  
A[2] = -6 
A[3] = 4  
A[4] = 0  

the function should return 5 because:
(3, 4) is a slice of A that has sum 4,
(2, 2) is a slice of A that has sum −6,
(0, 1) is a slice of A that has sum 5,
no other slice of A has sum greater than (0, 1).

Assume that:
N is an integer within the range [1..1,000,000];
each element of array A is an integer within the range [−1,000,000..1,000,000];
the result will be an integer within the range [−2,147,483,648..2,147,483,647].

Elements of input arrays can be modified.
